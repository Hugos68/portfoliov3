			Hey, I'm Hugo Korte, also known as Hugos68. I'm a coffee-fueled developer based in the
			Netherlands, currently in my third year of studying Computer Science.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm particularly passionate about frontend development, and I've been really enjoying working
			with Svelte (This portfolio was built using it).
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of my studies and coding, I'm an avid gamer. I love both video games and board games,
			and they provide a great way for me to unwind and have fun.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tech world constantly presents new challenges, and I thrive on problem-solving and
			learning. As I continue my studies and dive deeper into frontend development, I'm excited
			about the opportunities for growth and innovation. It's an exciting journey, and I'm looking
			forward to what's ahead.
